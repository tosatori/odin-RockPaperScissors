This Exercise is part of the Odin Project. It`s the first project in the foundations tracks basic javascript section. The goal of this exercise is to build a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissor" game from scratch.

By writing this game I learned about planning out a project ahead of coding and breaking it into smaller chunks. I used all the basic javascript concepts I have learned so far like conditionals, loops, input and output, declaring and callling functions.

Update

By updating and reworking this project I learned about adding and removing elements to the webpage and adding eventlisteners to buttons by manipulating the DOM. I learned how to refactor my code to meet new requirements.
